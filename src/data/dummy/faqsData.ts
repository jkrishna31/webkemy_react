    question: "What is this UI library used for?",
    answer:
      "This UI library provides a collection of reusable, accessible, and customizable components designed to speed up frontend development.\n\nInstead of building common UI patterns from scratch, you can focus on product logic while maintaining visual and behavioral consistency across your application."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Does the library support responsive design?",
    answer:
      "Yes. All components are responsive by default and adapt automatically to different screen sizes.\n\nLayouts, typography, and interactive elements scale smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices without requiring additional configuration."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Can I customize the styles and themes?",
    answer:
      "The library is built with customization in mind. You can override default styles using CSS variables, theme tokens, or your own design system.\n\nThis makes it easy to match existing brand guidelines or create multiple themes such as light and dark modes."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "Is the library accessible (a11y) compliant?",
    answer:
      "Accessibility is treated as a first-class feature, not an afterthought. Components follow WAI-ARIA standards and support keyboard navigation.\n\nFocus states, semantic markup, and screen reader compatibility are included out of the box to ensure an inclusive user experience."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Does it work with frameworks like React or Next.js?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The library integrates smoothly with modern frameworks such as React and Next.js.\n\nIt supports server-side rendering, hydration-safe components, and common patterns used in production-grade applications."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "How does the library handle animations and reduced motion preferences?",
    answer:
      "Animations are lightweight and used only where they improve clarity or feedback.\n\nIf a user has enabled the `prefers-reduced-motion` setting in their system, the library automatically minimizes or disables animations to respect accessibility preferences."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Is tree-shaking supported?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Components are exported individually so modern bundlers can remove unused code.\n\nThis helps keep bundle sizes small and ensures that you only ship what your application actually uses."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "Can I use this library in commercial projects?",
    answer:
      "The library can be used in both personal and commercial projects, depending on the license terms.\n\nBefore shipping to production, it’s recommended to review the license file to understand redistribution and attribution requirements."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "How often is the library updated?",
    answer:
      "The library is actively maintained and receives regular updates.\n\nThese updates typically include bug fixes, performance improvements, documentation updates, and occasionally new components based on community feedback."

  {
    id: 10,
    question: "Where can I report bugs or request new features?",
    answer:
      "Bugs and feature requests can be submitted through the project’s issue tracker.\n\nProviding clear reproduction steps, screenshots, or code examples helps maintainers review and address issues more efficiently."
